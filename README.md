## Resources

Github page for ESP32 Camera Webserver by Easytarget.  I like how he made an easy to use API. [https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver](https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver)

Good introduction on the ESP32 Cam on Youtube from Dronebot Workshop.  His Wifi Manager video and other videos are also quite good.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPlN_Tk3VLQ&t=2090s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPlN_Tk3VLQ&t=2090s)

Pretty Good introduction to ESP32-Cam that shows off it’s face-recognition capability.  This one uses the web camera server code from Espressif, the company behind the ESP32, but the face recognition is limited to 320x240 and the stream is in MJEG, so I didn’t not to use it.[https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/)
